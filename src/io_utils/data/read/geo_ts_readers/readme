Each dataset gets its own, (geo) reader that knows where the data is
stored (local, project PCs, in the GEO network), but can be extended
to other (fallback) paths.

The readers are mostly based on the official packages (github), but we
have implemented some features, so that the can be combined into a
GeoDsTsReader to easily read multiple datasets.
    This includes a resampling function in each reader
